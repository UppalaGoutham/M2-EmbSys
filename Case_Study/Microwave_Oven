# INTRODUCTION:
              A microwave oven, is a kitchen appliance that can come in many different sizes and styles employing microwave radiation primarily to cook or heat food. 
              This is accomplished by using microwaves, almost always emitted from a magnetron, to excite water (primarily) and other polarized molecules within the 
              food to be heated. This excitation is fairly uniform, leading to food being heated everywhere all at once.
