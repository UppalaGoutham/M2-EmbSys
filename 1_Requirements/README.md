# Introduction:
           • Radar is a long-range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of 
             an object like its range, speed and position.
           • The project is based on Sonar technology as I will be using an Ultrasonic Sensor to determine the presence 
             of any object in a particular range.
           • Rader is an object detection system. It uses Microwaves to determine the range, altitude, direction, or speed of
             objects. The radar can transmit radio waves or microwaves which bounce off any object in their path. So, we can 
             easily determine any object in the radar range.
             
# Requirements:

## High Level Requirements:
               
                    • It can able to detect Moving object.
                    • Moving object signal will displayed on a display unit.
                    
## Low Level Requirements:

                    •We can find the location of an Target.
                    •It can display position (moving or stationary) of an object.
                    •It can display distance of an object.
                    •It can display speed of an object.
