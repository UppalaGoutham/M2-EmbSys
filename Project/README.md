# Introduction To Ultrasonic Distance Detect Rader:
           • Radar is a long-range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of 
             an object like its range, speed and position.
           • The project is based on Sonar technology as I will be using an Ultrasonic Sensor to determine the presence 
             of any object in a particular range.
           • Rader is an object detection system. It uses Microwaves to determine the range, altitude, direction, or speed of
             objects. The radar can transmit radio waves or microwaves which bounce off any object in their path. So, we can 
             easily determine any object in the radar range.
             
# Requirements:

## High Level Requirements:
| ID | Description |
|--|--|
| HR01 | It can send echo to find object  |
| HR02 | It can able to detect Moving object |
| HR03 | Moving object signal will displayed on a display unit |
                    
## Low Level Requirements:

                    •We can find the location of an Target.
                    •It can display position (moving or stationary) of an object.
                    •It can display distance of an object.
                    •It can display speed of an object.

# Components:

## Microcontroller ATmega128:

              •ATmega128 is an AVR, 8-bit low power microcontroller that contains 64-pin interface and is based on RISC architecture.
              •This AVR controller differs from PIC controllers in accordance with the instruction set where AVR. requires one clock 
               cycle to execute a number of instructions while PIC controllers need a number.
            
## Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04:
             •The ultrasonic sensor works on the principle of SONAR and RADAR system which is used to determine the distance 
              to an object.
             •An ultrasonic sensor generates the highfrequency sound (ultrasound) waves. When this ultrasound hits the object,
              it reflects as echo which is sensed by the receiver.
              
## Servomotor :
             • A servomotor is a rotational actuator that allows for the precise control of the angular position, velocity
               and acceleration.
             • It receives and processes PWM signal. Servomotor can rotate approximately 180 degrees (90 degree in each direction).
             
## LCD Display :
             • The term LCD stands for liquid crystal display. It is one kind of electronic display module used in an extensive 
              range of applications like various circuits and devices like mobile phones, calculators, computers, TV sets, etc.
             •These displays are mainly preferred for multi-segment light-emitting diodes and seven segment display.
             
## Buzzer:
             •Buzzer is used for alerting the user at the completion of the cooking process.
             
## power supply:
             •A power supply is an electronic circuit that converts the voltage of an alternating current (AC) 
              into a direct current (DC) voltage.
              
# Advantages:
            •The ultrasonic sensor has high sensitivity, high frequency and high penetrating power therefore it can easily
              detect the external or deep objects.
            •The use of ultrasonic sensor makes this system more accurate and precise than other methods.
            •This system is easy to use, not dangerous during operation for nearby objects, person, equipment or material.
            •Radar systems have a number of defense as well as civil applications.
            
# Applications:
           •It is used in machines like Automotive parking sensor obstacle warning systems,industrial distance
            measurements, terrain monitoring robots.
           •RADAR speed meters are used by the traffic police for enforcing speed limit.
           •Marine RADARs used to locate the landmarks and other ships.
           •Air traffic control uses radars to track aircraft on the ground, in the air and to guide planes for smooth landings.
