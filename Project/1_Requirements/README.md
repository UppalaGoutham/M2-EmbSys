# Introduction To Ultrasonic Distance Detect Rader:
             Radar is a long-range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of an object 
             like its range, speed and position.The project is based on Sonar technology as I will be using an Ultrasonic Sensor
             to determine the presence of any object in a particular range.Rader is an object detection system. It uses Microwaves
             to determine the range, altitude, direction, or speed of objects. 
             
                     •The radar can transmit radio waves or microwaves which bounce off any object in their path. So, we can 
                      easily determine any object in the radar range.
                     •Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 works on the principle of SONAR and RADAR system.
                     •HC-SR-04 module has an ultrasonic transmitter, receiver, and control circuit on a single board
             
# Requirements:

## High Level Requirements:
| ID | Description |
|--|--|
| HR01 | It can send echo to find object  |
| HR02 | It can able to detect Moving object |
| HR03 | Moving object signal will displayed on a display unit |
                    
## Low Level Requirements:

| ID | Description | HR ID |
